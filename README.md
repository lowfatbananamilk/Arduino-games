# Arduino games

I have an Arduino, and I like games.
***
Currently there's only one game, so the one .ino is independent. I'll devide the games in .c and the other interfaces in .ino when i get more games ready.

To-Do list
+ ~~Upload "Ready. Steady. BANG!"~~
+ Make a list of games to make
+ Create main.ino and make selection interface
+ Remake "Ready Steady BANG" to be loaded in main.ino
